I have worked with the large-scale volumetric action recognition datasets which are bigger by several orders of magnitude compared to ImageNet. 

I have a solid background to work on cross-dataset problems, I understand very well (i) concepts of distribution shift between datasets (ii) issues with generalization to new class concepts (iii) issues underpinning model failures due to out-of-distribution situations (iv) issues resulting from low sample counts, and so forth. 

My knowledge gained from past research experience span several computer vision and machine learning disciplines including camera projective geometry, graph neural networks, and optimal transportation (apart from action recognition and few-shot learning).

I am working on the following projects:

* Automatic Training Data Search and Model Evaluation by Measuring Domain Gap

* Human action recognition (robust human action modelling)
  * Action recognition in videos 
  * Action recognition in skeleton sequences

* Industrial research project
  * One- & few-shot anomaly detection
  * Anomaly detection in skeleton sequences
