  * Research student: [Supasun Khumpraphan](https://micsupasun.github.io/)

<h2>Research grant / funding</h2>

* Sharing early insights for more resilient communities
  * I am a Co-Investigator (Co-I).
  * This project is a joint initiative with the Southern NSW Drought Resilience Adoption and Innovation Hub and forms part of the Australian Government’s Agricultural Innovation Hubs Program. The project is being conducted by the University of Canberra, Australian National University, Charles Sturt University, and University of Wollongong.
  * The project is to develop and test ‘early warning’ indicators for loss of resilience following challenging climate-related events. These indicators will be used to develop a resource that can be used to by the wide range of organisations and services to identify communities in the early stages of resilience loss and provide targeted support to agricultural communities.
  * Through understanding early warning signs that individuals and communities are at risk of resilience loss, we could inform policy and support service interventions earlier. This would provide communities with the necessary support to mitigate wider and longer lasting resilience loss related to the impacts of a climate events, which in turn, would reduce the overall harm to lives and livelihoods and facilitate resilience building across physical, psychological, social, economic, domains.


<!-- <h2>Personal statement</h2> -->

<!-- I am a hardworking, passionate and self-disciplined researcher. -->
  
<!-- I have worked with the <font color="blue">large-scale volumetric</font> action recognition datasets which are bigger by several orders of magnitude compared to ImageNet.  -->

<!-- I have learnt to deal efficiently with complex projects given <font color="blue">limited computational resources</font> (albeit HPC-based). -->

<!-- I have a solid background to work on <font color="blue">cross-dataset problems</font>, I understand very well (i) concepts of distribution shift between datasets (ii) issues with generalization to new class concepts (iii) issues underpinning model failures due to out-of-distribution situations (iv) issues resulting from low sample counts, and so forth.  -->

<!-- My knowledge gained from past research experience span several <font color="blue">computer vision and machine learning disciplines</font> including camera projective geometry, graph neural networks, and optimal transportation (apart from action recognition and few-shot learning). -->

<!-- I have delivered a number of strong scientific ideas as witnessed by my (i) academic outputs (papers in high quality venues) and (ii) practical knowledge of action recognition / anomaly detection systems (patents). -->

<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
<!-- <h2>Research interests</h2> -->

<!-- My interests include action recognition in videos, anomaly detection, video image processing, one- and few-shot learning, deep learning, tensor learning and domain adaptation. -->
