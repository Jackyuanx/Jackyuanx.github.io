<h2>Personal statement</h2>

I am a hardworking, passionate and self-disciplined researcher.
  
I have worked with the <font color="blue">large-scale volumetric</font> action recognition datasets which are bigger by several orders of magnitude compared to ImageNet. 

I have learnt to deal efficiently with complex projects given <font color="blue">limited computational resources</font> (albeit HPC-based).

I have a solid background to work on <font color="blue">cross-dataset problems</font>, I understand very well (i) concepts of distribution shift between datasets (ii) issues with generalization to new class concepts (iii) issues underpinning model failures due to out-of-distribution situations (iv) issues resulting from low sample counts, and so forth. 

My knowledge gained from past research experience span several <font color="blue">computer vision and machine learning disciplines</font> including camera projective geometry, graph neural networks, and optimal transportation (apart from action recognition and few-shot learning).

I have delivered a number of strong scientific ideas as witnessed by my (i) academic outputs (papers in high quality venues) and (ii) practical knowledge of action recognition / anomaly detection systems (patents).
