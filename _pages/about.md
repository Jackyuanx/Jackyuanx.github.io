I am Xiuyuan (Jack) Yuan, and I am a first year undergraduate research student with the School of Computing, ANU College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics under the supervision of [Dr. Lei Wang](https://leiwangr.github.io/) (ANU).

I am interested in participating in research and building/fitting models for tasks, so feel free to reach out to me via my email, as I am available for activities such as kaggle competitions.
