He is currently also a Computer Scientist with the Active Intelligence Australia Pty Ltd, Perth. He leads the research and development of commercial anomaly detection solutions, and the project has raised 1.2 million US dollars. Since then, he has been granted the Incentive Unit Award.

Since 2018, he has been a full-time Computer Vision Researcher with iCetana Pty Ltd. He was a Visiting Researcher in Machine Learning Research Group at Data61/CSIRO (former NICTA). He was also a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, UWA.

Before starting his PhD at ANU and Data61/CSIRO, he has been offered a number of competitive full PhD scholarships including ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre Scholarship, UWA International Fee Scholarship, University Postgraduate Award, Data61 PhD Scholarship, Data61 Top-up Scholarship and ANU HDR Fee Remission Merit Scholarship.

He has published a large number of first-author papers during his PhD candidature in high quality venues (Rank A* conferences or journals with impact factor > 10.0) including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACM MM, TPAMI and TIP under the supervision of [Dr. Piotr Koniusz](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~koniusz/) (Data61/CSIRO & ANU). He also received the Sang Uk Lee Best Student Paper Award from ACCV'22.

His research interests include action recognition in videos, anomaly detection, video image processing, one- and few-shot learning, deep learning, tensor learning and domain adaptation.

He is an IEEE Student Member and an ACM Student Member.
