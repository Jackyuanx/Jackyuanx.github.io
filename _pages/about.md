Mr. Xiuyuan (Jack) Yuan is a second-year undergraduate research student at the School of Computing, ANU College of Engineering, Computing, and Cybernetics.

Currently, he is a summer scholar engaged in researching video dynamics distillation, supported by the National Computing Infrastructure (NCI). As a participant in the Summer Research Internship Program, he has been awarded with the ANU Summer Research Scholarship. Under the supervision of [Dr. Lei Wang](https://leiwangr.github.io/) (ANU & Data61/CSIRO), he actively contributes as an assistant researcher, delving into topics such as multi-modal foundation models, robust anomaly detection in human-centric videos, and scalable models using video dynamics distillation.

He is also the lead researcher in developing light-weight video data formats, capable of efficiently distilling motions at various granular levels. His research has the potential to significantly impact safety and security, future cities, IoT, agribusiness, and defense, with applications in health, wellbeing, safety, and innovative industries.

His work centers around exploring advanced technologies, to support all areas of science and society, ultimately providing national benefits. Additionally, Xiuyuan is a recipient of the Australian Government Digital Cadetship at the Attorney-General's Department.

His research interests encompass action recognition, video image processing, and deep learning.
